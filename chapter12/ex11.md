# When would you need to create a dynamic Keras model? How do you do that? Why not make all your models dynamic?
To make a model dynamic set dynamic=true when creating it. Making a model dynmic prevents kera from using ano f tensorflow's graph features. So it will slow down training and inference. But you  can use the python debugger to debug the cost function.
