# Suppose you want to classify pictures as outdoor/indoor and daytime/nighttime. Should you implement two Logistic Regression classifiers or one Softmax Regression classifier.

A Softmax regression classifier only does mutually exclusive classes. This is clearly no the case here (like it could be both outdoor and nighttime). So two logisitc Regression classifiers seems like the better option.
