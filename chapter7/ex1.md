# If you have trained five different models on the exact same training data, and they all achieve 95% precision, is there any chance that you can combine these models to get better results? If so, how? If not, why?

Yes, if the five models are different kinds of algorithms, if they are sufficiently different.
They will make different mistakes.
And when combined will give better results.
