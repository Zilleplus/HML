# What makes Extra-Trees more random than regular Random Forest. HOw can this extra randomness help? Are Extra-Trees slower or faster than Random Forest?
The extra trees chose the feature treshholds used in the splitting randomly, instead of finding the random one. 
Find the optimal split treshhold is a computational hard problem, so picking it random speeds up the learning process, and it add's an other layer of randomness.
