# What is the difference between hard and soft voting classifier?
A hard classfier can only tell you to what class a new sample belongs. 
When used in ensamble it will take the side with the most votes.
While a soft classifier can also tell you how likely it is a sample belongs to a certain class. 
This classifier will take the average when used in ensemble.
