# Say you've trained a SVM classfier with an RBF kernel, but it seems to underfit the training set. Should you increase or decrease gamma? What about C?

Gamma act's as a regularization parameter, increasing it will potentially decrease the underfitting. C is also a regularization parameter, increasing it might help as well.
