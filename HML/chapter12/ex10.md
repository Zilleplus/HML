# What are the main rules to respect if you want a function to be convertible to a TF function

you have 2 options:
1. define a python function that internaly only uses tf operations.
2. define a regular function that only uses vanila python. It should not contain library call's or have side effects. By annotating it will be converterted automatically in the first option.
