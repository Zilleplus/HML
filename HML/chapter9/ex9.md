# Can you name two techniques to find the right number of clusters when using a Gaussian Mixture model?
- BIC: Bayesian information criterion
    Optimizes to get simpler models, doesn't fit data as well.
- AIC: Akaike informatin criterion
    Fits the data better, very usefull on large datasets.

-> Apperently these 2 are counted as 1 techinque in the answers. The other technique is too use the Baysian Gaussian Mixture, as you don't need to define that number in this algo.
