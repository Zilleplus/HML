#Ex1: What are the advatanges of a CNN over a fully connected DNN for image classification.
1. faster to compute predict.
2. Allows for reasoning on in depth information due to the use of filters.
3. less parameters to find.

#Ex2: Consider a CNN composed of 3 convolution layes, each with 3x3 kernels and a stride of 2, and same padding. The lowest layer outputs 100 feature maps, the middle one outputs 200, and the top one outputs400. The input images are RGB images of 200x300 pixels.

3*3 kernel = 9 elements
picture of stride 2 -> skip 2 elements
same padding -> fill with zeros

100/200/400 feature maps


a) What is the total number of parameters in the CNN? 

b) If we are using 32-bit floats, at least how much RAM will this network require when making a predictuion for a single instance?

c) What about when training on mini-batch of 50 images.
