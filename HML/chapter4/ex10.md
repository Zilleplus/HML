# Why would you want to use:

- Ridge Regression instead of plain linear regression
Regularization can avoid overfitting.
- Lasso instead of Ridge Regression
Lasso uses absolute value in it's regularization term, while Ridge uses squares. This causes Lasso to eliminate a feature faster then the Ridge regression (that will keep it small but not zero). So use Lasso if you know there are only a few valid features.
- Elastic net instead of Lasso
Elastic net combines Lasso with Ridge, which makes a better then lasso when there are a lot of features. Lasso might act erratically if there are too many features.
