# What is the difference between anomality detection and novelty detection?

Novelty detection assumes the dataset is clean, uncontaminated by outliers. Where as anomalty detection does not make this assumption. Novelty detection will use the trained model to identify novel instances in new data. While anamalty detection searches in it's training set for outliers.
