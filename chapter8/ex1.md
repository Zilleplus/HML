# What are the main motivations for reducing a dataset's dimensionality? What are the main drawback?
## Advantages
- Significantly faster training
- Easier to visualize
- Compression
## Disadvantages
- Calculation time (is an extra step, might not pay off in calc time)
- Potential loss of data
- When a dimension reduction technique is used in the pipeline the
features are harder to reason about.
