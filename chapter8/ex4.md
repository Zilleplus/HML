# Can PCA be used to reduce the dimensionality of a highly non-linear dataset?
original asnwer: Yes but the you have to use the kernel variant, also known as kPCA. As the classical PCA only works on linear variations.

In the appendix they say that even with non-linear data, the vanilla PCA can eliminate the useless dimensions.
